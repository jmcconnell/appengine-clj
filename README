This library is based off of the work of duelinmarkers, located at:

http://github.com/duelinmarkers/appengine-clj/tree/master

So far, the interfaces to the AppEngine User library is left out, as are the
test utilities. However, the datastore support, in
com.ubermensch.appengine-clj.datastore has received worthwhile new features,
including the ability to store Clojure datastructures, like sets, vectors and
lists.
